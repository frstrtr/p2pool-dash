                    🎉 BLOCK FOUND — DROUGHT OVER 🎉

Note: Blocks listed here were found by MINERS ON THE P2POOL NETWORK,
not by this specific node. This node has no miners connected — it
acts as a relay. Shares and blocks propagate across p2pool's peer-to-
peer network and appear in the local sharestore.

Hash quality summary (PoW diff / net diff):
  Block #1:  1.15x   — solid pass
  Block #2:  4.57x   — exceptional hash quality
  Block #3:  2.51x   — strong hash quality
  Block #4:  1.00x   — barely passed target (equally valid!)

Note: Hash quality (PoW diff / net diff) is NOT a measure of luck.
Luck = time to find a block vs expectation. Hash quality measures
how far the PoW hash exceeded the network target. A block at 1.00x
is equally valid and equally "lucky" as one at 4.57x. However, hash
quality is valuable data for future temporal level organization.

======================================================================
THE DROUGHT — BY THE NUMBERS
======================================================================
Previous block:   2026-02-04 15:52:06 UTC
Recovery block:   2026-02-07 16:58:14 UTC
Total drought:    73 hours 6 minutes (3.05 days)

Drought probability thresholds crossed:
  ✓ 50% chance of drought >= 10.8 hours (0.5 days)
  ✓ 25% chance of drought >= 21.6 hours (0.9 days)
  ✓ 10% chance of drought >= 35.9 hours (1.5 days)
  ✓  5% chance of drought >= 46.7 hours (1.9 days)
  ✓  1% chance of drought >= 71.8 hours (3.0 days)  ← broke through here

The drought reached the 1% probability threshold before ending.
In other words, 99% of the time the pool would have found a block
sooner. A genuinely rare event, but not impossible.

Note on "luck": Luck in mining is purely about TIME — how long it
takes to find a block relative to statistical expectation. The ratio
of actual PoW diff to network diff in a found block is NOT a measure
of luck — it is simply the hash quality of that particular share.
A block that barely passes the target is equally valid and equally
"lucky" as one that exceeds it by 4x. The hash quality metric may
be useful for other purposes (e.g. temporal level organization).

======================================================================
WHAT WE INVESTIGATED & RULED OUT
======================================================================

1. SOFTWARE BUGS                                          ❌ Not the cause
   - Every share verified for correct PoW hashing
   - Difficulty comparison logic confirmed correct
   - Block template from Dash Core normal
   - No submission bugs (no blocks existed to submit)

2. DASHMATE 3 / PLATFORM v3.0                             ❌ Not the cause
   - Layer-2 update only (Platform Addresses, SDK)
   - No changes to PoW mining or consensus rules
   - Dash Core v23.0.2 fully up to date
   - No new version bits or softforks

3. 42% UNKNOWN MINER                                      ❌ Not the cause
   - Mining is memoryless — dominant miner doesn't
     change other miners' block probability
   - ChainLocks (DIP-0008) prevents 51% attacks
   - LLMQ of 400 masternodes signs each block
   - Need ~30% of masternodes to break (not hashrate)

4. NODE/NETWORK ISSUES                                     ❌ Not the cause
   - Dash Core synced, no warnings
   - ChainLocks active at height 2,418,558
   - Block template generating correctly
   - Pool producing ~200+ shares/hour consistently

5. STATISTICAL BAD LUCK                                    ✅ THE CAUSE
   - 1% probability event (1 in ~100)
   - Shares consistently reached high PoW difficulties
   - Multiple shares came within 1.05x–2x of target
   - Final block beat target by 15% when it came

======================================================================
CLOSEST SHARES DURING THE DROUGHT — HALL OF NEAR-MISSES

These shares came closest to being blocks but didn't quite make it:

Feb 07 16:14        1.4519   75,189,555     109,166,726     45% away

POOL PERFORMANCE DURING DROUGHT

All blocks found by miners on the p2pool network (not this node).

                    Block-finding     Drought          Overall
                    (Feb 3-4)         (Feb 4-7)        (Feb 3-7)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Duration            23.2 hours        73.1 hours       96.3 hours
Shares              ~4,100            ~18,000+         ~22,000+
Blocks found        6                 0 → 1            7
Expected blocks     ~4.0              ~9.5             ~13.5
Pool hashrate       22.3 TH/s        17-20 TH/s       ~19 TH/s
Pool fraction       0.71%             0.54%            ~0.6%

The pool was LUCKY in the first period (found blocks faster than
expected) and UNLUCKY in the drought (took much longer than
expected). Luck = time to find blocks vs expected time.

======================================================================
KEY TAKEAWAYS
======================================================================

1. VARIANCE IS REAL — Even with consistent hashrate and correct
   software, droughts happen. A 3-day drought at 0.5% pool
   fraction is rare (~1%) but inevitable over long timeframes.

2. THE MATH WORKS — Our probability calculations were accurate.
   We predicted 12.3% chance per hour, and the block came within
   23 minutes of that calculation. The Poisson model is reliable.

3. NO PANIC NEEDED — Thorough investigation confirmed everything
   was working correctly. The temptation to "fix" something that
   isn't broken could have introduced real problems.

4. MONITORING MATTERS — The analysis tools (check_sharestore_stats,
   check_sharestore_blocks) proved invaluable for diagnosing the
   situation and maintaining confidence in the pool's operation.

5. DASH IS RESILIENT — ChainLocks protect against 51% attacks
   regardless of mining centralization. The 42% unknown miner
   is a centralization concern but not an existential threat.
